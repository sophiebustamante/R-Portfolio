## Background

-   In December 2009, an outbreak occurred following a restaurant exposure to a foodborne pathogen over many days. More information is in the paper reporting the outbreak, if you are interested, but not necessary that you read the article. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21524343/

-   CDC and the local health departments conducted a study of those who fell ill, as well as their household contacts. They found that this outbreak was a result of oysters consumed at the restaurant that were contaminated with norovirus.

-   This dataset presents a good opportunity to study natural history, because there is a *known time of exposure* (in hours) for the cases who dined at the restaurant. In addition, there are data on illnesses among the household contacts who did not dine at the restaurant. That way, we can also look at the natural history among household contacts.

### The spreadsheet ‘NaturalHistoryExercise.csv’ contains the data, which you can save from Canvas or import directly into R from the web as follows:

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
data <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blopman/epi569/master/NaturalHistoryExercise.csv")) #%>% rename(HOUSEHOLD_ = ï..HOUSEHOLD_) #you may need to run the commented out code if the HOUSEHOLD_ variable is read in wrong
```

-   You can see all the data on times of exposure, onset of symptoms and time of last symptom episode. The **HOUSEHOLD\_** variable indicated which household the person was a member; and **HOUSEHOLD_INDEX** indicated if the person got ill at the restaurant. The other fields should be self-explanatory.

-   We have calculated the key values for each person for you. For each, there is a value for the linear scale (DAYS) and log scale (LOG DAYS). You can explore the rest of the dataset, but most wont be needed for this exercise.

    -   **INDEX_INCUBATION_DAYS** -- The time from dining at the restaurant to onset of symptoms in index cases
    -   **SERIAL_INTERVAL_DAYS** -- The time from onset of illness in the index case to the onset in the household contact
    -   **DURATION_DAYS** -- The time from the onset of symptoms to the end of illness in all cases.

## It is recommended that you use **R**

-   If you use **R**, the following functions will be useful to you:
    -   median(data\$**VARIABLE_NAME**, na.rm=TRUE) -- Median
    -   sd(data\$**VARIABLE_NAME**, na.rm=TRUE) -- Standard deviation
    -   log(data\$**VARIABLE_NAME**, na.rm=TRUE) -- Natural log
    -   exp(data\$**VARIABLE_NAME**, na.rm=TRUE) -- Exponentiate

## Now for your work. For this outbreak:

### Question 1 **(1pt)**

-   Calculate *the incubation period*:
    -   the median of the incubation period
    -   the median of the log incubation period
    -   the standard deviation of the log incubation period
    -   the dispersion, which is exp(sd)

### ANSWER

### median of the incubation period: 1.79 days

### median of the log incubation period: 0.58 log days

### standard deviation of the log incubation period: 0.49 log days

### dispersion: 1.63 log days

```{r}
median(data$INDEX_INCUBATION_DAYS, na.rm=TRUE)
median(data$INDEX_INCUBATION_LOG_DAYS, na.rm=TRUE)
sd(data$INDEX_INCUBATION_LOG_DAYS, na.rm=TRUE)
exp(0.4895947)
```

-   Because incubation periods are log-normally distributed, 66% of cases should fall within the median/exp(sd) and median\*exp(sd). Does that appear to be the case?

```{r}
0.58/1.63 #0.3558282 
0.58*1.63 #0.9454 
lower_bound<- 0.3558282 
upper_bound<- 0.9454 
round(100*
      nrow (data %>% filter(!is.na(INDEX_INCUBATION_LOG_DAYS), INDEX_INCUBATION_LOG_DAYS >= lower_bound, INDEX_INCUBATION_LOG_DAYS <= upper_bound)) / nrow(data %>% filter(!is.na(INDEX_INCUBATION_LOG_DAYS))) 
)
```

### ANSWER

### About 68% of cases fall within the interval, so this does appear to be the case as it's close to 66%

-   Now, *use the following commands* to plot the distribution of this variable and a fitted log-normal distribution as follows:
    -   Create a variable without all the missing data
    -   Fit a log normal distribution
    -   Look at the parameters of this log normal distribution
    -   Plot the log normal distribution along with the data (histogram)

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
incubation<-data$INDEX_INCUBATION_DAYS[!is.na(data$INDEX_INCUBATION_DAYS)]
incubation_fit_ln <- fitdist(incubation, "lnorm")
summary(incubation_fit_ln)
denscomp(incubation_fit_ln,
         main="Density of Incubation Period (log-normal fit)",
         xlab="Incubation Days",
         ylab="Density")
```

### Question 2 **(1pt)**

-   Calculate the same four values (median of the incubation period, the median of the log incubation period, the standard deviation of the log incubation period, and the dispersion) and generate the same plot, this time for *the serial interval*.
    -   Did you find a wide distribution of serial intervals (i.e. observed serial intervals of many different lengths)? If so, why do think that could be?

```{r}
median(data$SERIAL_INTERVAL_DAYS, na.rm=TRUE)

median(data$SERIAL_INTERVAL_LOG_DAYS, na.rm=TRUE) 

sd(data$SERIAL_INTERVAL_LOG_DAYS, na.rm=TRUE) 

exp(0.7061295) 

serial<-data$SERIAL_INTERVAL_DAYS[!is.na(data$SERIAL_INTERVAL_DAYS)] 
serial_fit_ln<- fitdist(serial, "lnorm") 
summary(serial_fit_ln) 
denscomp(serial_fit_ln,
         main="Density of Serial Interval Days (log-normal fit)",
         xlab="Serial Interval Days",
         ylab="Density") 
```

### ANSWER

### median of the incubation period: 2.42 days

### median of the log incubation period: 0.90 log days

### standard deviation of the log incubation period: 0.71 log days

### dispersion: 2.03 log days

### Yes, there is a wide distribution of serial intervals, from 0 to beyond 12. This could be because of variability in behavior of cases. For example, some index cases may have tried their best to quarantine, but eventually transmitted to the household case despite their best efforts. This could have prolonged the time between onset of symptoms. Another reason this could be the case is the variability in people's immune system and response. Some responses could start earlier, triggering symptoms, and some immune responses could be delayed. Thus, this biological component could influence this wide distribution. Similarly, it could be explained by various viral loads: cases with higher viral loads would most likely have symptoms sooner and vice versa. Additionally, not all index cases were exposed and having symptoms at the same time, so it would make sense that they transmit it to others at different times as well.

### Question 3 **(1pt)**

-   Finally, calculate the same four values (median of the incubation period, the median of the log incubation period, the standard deviation of the log incubation period, and the dispersion) and generate the same plot, this time for *the duration of illness*.

```{r}
median(data$DURATION_DAYS, na.rm=TRUE) 

median(data$DURATION_LOG_DAYS, na.rm=TRUE) 

sd(data$DURATION_LOG_DAYS, na.rm=TRUE) 

exp(1.345742)

duration<-data$DURATION_DAYS[!is.na(data$DURATION_DAYS) & data$DURATION_DAYS > 0]
duration_fit_ln<- fitdist(duration, "lnorm") 
summary(duration_fit_ln) 
denscomp(duration_fit_ln,
         main="Density of Duration Days",
         xlab="Duration Days",
         ylab="Density")
```

### ANSWER

### 0.75 days

### -0.26 log days

### 1.35 log days

### 3.84 log days

### Question 4 **(1pt)**

-   Are the values you calculated for (1-3) consistent with norovirus as the cause of the outbreak? Research online for the natural history parameters for norovirus to justify your answer.

### ANSWER

### Overall the values from 1-3 are fairly consistent with norovirus' natural history parameters: According to the NIH, the incubation is approximately 1-2 days (Capece and Ginac, 2023), and I got a median value of 1.79 days which falls between that interval. Similarly, the NIH website says the median serial interval is 2.2 days, and this data gives a median of 2.24 days, which is reasonably close to 2.2. The duration is also consistent with NIH's numbers: the NIH says the duration of illness is between 12-60 hours (0.5-2.5 days) (Capece and Ginac, 2023), and this data yields a median of 0.75 days. Thus, norovirus is likely the cause of the outbreak.

### Question 5 **(1pt)**

-   Calculate the secondary attack rate among household contacts.
    -   *(number ill /number exposed)*

```{r}
subset_data<-data[data$HOUSEHOLD_INDEX=="N", ] #126 total (denominator)
table(subset_data$ILL=="Y") #34 ill in subset (numerator) 
34/126 #=0.2698413-->27% 
```

### ANSWER

### 27%

### Question 6 \[Extra Credit\] **(0.5pt)**

-   Calculate and plot the distribution of secondary attack rates by household.

```{r}
library(dplyr) 
SECONDARY_ATTACK_RATE<-subset_data %>% group_by(HOUSEHOLD_) %>% 
summarise(SECONDARY_ATTACK_RATE= sum(ILL=="Y")/ max(MEMBER_NUMBER, na.rm=TRUE))

subset_data<-subset_data %>% left_join(SECONDARY_ATTACK_RATE, by ="HOUSEHOLD_")

secondary_attack_rate<-subset_data$SECONDARY_ATTACK_RATE[!is.na(subset_data$SECONDARY_ATTACK_RATE) & subset_data$SECONDARY_ATTACK_RATE >0]
secondary_attack_rate_fit_ln<- fitdist(secondary_attack_rate, "lnorm") 
summary(secondary_attack_rate_fit_ln) 
denscomp(secondary_attack_rate_fit_ln,
         main="Density of Secondary Attack Rates",
         xlab="Secondary Attack Rates",
         ylab="Density")
```
